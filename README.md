In this project, I have created a collection of recipes using HTML. Each recipe is displayed on a separate page, making it easy for users to browse and find the recipe they are interested in. The project includes the following features:

Responsive design: The recipes are optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
Navigation: Users can easily navigate through the recipe pages using a navigation menu.
Ingredients and instructions: Each recipe page includes a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions, making it easy for users to follow along.
# usage
