    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <h3>For the Puris:</h3>

<li>In a mixing bowl, combine semolina, all-purpose flour, and salt. Gradually add water and knead into a stiff dough. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>

<li>After resting, knead the dough again for a couple of minutes. Divide it into small portions and roll them into small, thin circles (approximately 2-3 inches in diameter).</li>

<li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in a few rolled puris at a time. Fry them until they puff up and turn golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining puris.

<li>In a large bowl, combine the strained green paste, tamarind pulp, chaat masala, roasted cumin powder, black salt, and regular salt. Mix well.</li>
