  <ul>
     <li><h2>Ingredients:</h2></li>
       <li>Cooked rice (preferably leftover and cooled)</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons oil (vegetable or sesame oil)</li>
       <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
       <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
       <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
       <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
       <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
       <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
       <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
       <li>Optional: cooked meat (such as chicken, shrimp, or ham), diced scallions for garnish</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the pan. Saut√© until the onion becomes translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the diced carrot and frozen peas to the pan. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
    <li>Push the vegetables to one side of the pan, creating a space to cook the eggs. Pour the beaten eggs into the empty space and scramble them until they are fully cooked.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked rice to the pan, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Stir-fry everything together, mixing the vegetables, eggs, and rice evenly.</li>
    <li>Drizzle the soy sauce over the rice and continue to stir-fry for a few more minutes, ensuring the sauce is well-distributed and coats the rice and vegetables.</li>
    <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Be cautious with salt if your soy sauce is already salty.</li>
    <li>If desired, you can add cooked meat (such as chicken, shrimp, or ham) at this point and stir-fry for an additional minute to heat it through.</li>
    <li>Once everything is well combined and heated, remove the fried rice from the heat.</li>
    <li>Garnish with diced scallions for added freshness and flavor</li>
